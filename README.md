Subtitle-Renamer
================

Renames your .srt files to match any video files in the same folder.

Any files already paired up will not be edited.

The pairings are done alphabetically; e.g. the first unpaired .srt file alphabetically will be paired with the
first .avi/mp4/mkv file alphabetically.

Currently the script only supports avi/mkv/mp4 file types but can easily be changed by adding more file types to the video_filetypes list.
